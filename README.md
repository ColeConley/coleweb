## About

Hi, I'm Cole Conley, an experienced IAM Developer/Engineer currently working at Deloitte. With a strong background in identity access management, I've worked at top firms such as PwC and Atos. My expertise includes integrating applications with SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0 for SSO, and developing authentication flows for Risk-Based Authentication on the ForgeRock platform. I'm skilled in data analysis, working with tools like Splunk, Excel, and SQL, and hold certifications in various Microsoft technologies. I'm passionate about enhancing security and access management processes and always looking for innovative solutions to complex problems.

In my free time, I enjoy working on Python scripts to automate identity management tasks, and I'm always eager to learn more about the latest developments in IAM and cybersecurity.
